abstract: This report investigates the application of machine learning models to classify the demographics of table swings based on racket kinematics data, with a strong focus on predicting a combined age and gender label. The Data Set originally sourced from DRYAD has slightly been modified for the purpose of this report. We apply and compare three supervised classification algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and One-vs-Rest Logistic Regression, evaluating their performance using known evaluation metrics. Our findings provide insights into the discriminative power of racket motion features and the behaviour of various classifiers on a real-word problem.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This report explores using machine learning to classify age and gender from racket kinematics during table swings, using a modified dataset from DRYAD. It compares KNN, SVM, and One-vs-Rest Logistic Regression, revealing how racket motion features influence classification performance.
